### Welcome to my corner of the web!

Here's a quick snapshot of what I'm about:

- My most recent project that I've finished was my [portfolio site](https://aleforniadreamin.github.io/) that I'm deploying with GitHub Pages (work in progress...).
- The project I'm working on now is a Django app to help improve my motorcycle riding skills
- I'm currently studying JavaScript and jQuery
- I'm looking to collaborate on awesome open source projects 
- Ask me about the transition from the military to the tech scene
